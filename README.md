WHEEL TEMPLATE FOR UNITY ENGINE CREATED BY COLIN MCINERNEY. NO ATTRIBUTION NECESSARY BUT A THANK-YOU IS ALWAYS NICE. :)

Created in Unity 2022.3.36f1. You may run into issues opening in an older version of the engine, but you can always just rip out the assets and rebuild a prefab inside.

This template was created for use in WHEELJAM and is otherwise free to use for anything you see fit. You are not required to use the provided templates for any WHEELJAM submissions.
